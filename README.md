# Specter Workflow System

AI-powered specification-driven development workflow for Claude Code.

## What is Specter?

Specter is a **meta MCP server** that generates platform-specific workflow automation tools for AI-driven development. It creates custom Claude Code commands and agents tailored to your project management platform (Linear, GitHub, or local Markdown files).

### Key Features

- **Platform abstraction** - Work with Linear, GitHub, or Markdown seamlessly
- **Quality-driven workflows** - Automated refinement loops with critic agents
- **Strategic to implementation** - Plan → Roadmap → Spec → Build
- **Type-safe integration** - Platform-specific tools properly configured

## Quick Start

Specter installation has two parts:
1. **One-time MCP server setup** (configure Specter globally)
2. **Per-project setup** (generate workflow files for each project)

### 1. MCP Server Setup (One-Time)

Configure Specter as an MCP server in Claude Code:

**Step 1: Clone Specter repository**
```bash
# Clone to a permanent location
cd ~/coding/projects  # or your preferred location
git clone git@github.com:mmcclatchy/specter.git
cd specter
uv sync  # Install dependencies
```

**Step 2: Add to Claude Code configuration**

Edit `~/.claude/config.json` and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "specter": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "spec-driven-workflow-server"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/specter"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/specter` with your actual path from Step 1. Use absolute paths, not `~` or relative paths.

**Step 3: Verify setup**

```bash
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:
```text
/mcp list
```

Expected output should include "specter" with 32 tools available.

### 2. Project Setup (Per-Project)

Once the MCP server is configured, set up any project:

**Local installation:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
~/coding/projects/specter/scripts/install-specter.sh
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:
```text
/specter-setup
/specter-plan  # Start your first workflow
```

**Remote installation (public repos only):**

> **⚠️ Important**: Remote installation only works for **public repositories**. For private repos, use local installation above.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmcclatchy/specter/main/scripts/install-specter.sh | bash
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:
```text
/specter-setup
/specter-plan  # Start your first workflow
```

**Bootstrap via Claude Code (alternative):**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

```text
Install the Specter bootstrap files for this project
/specter-setup
```

### 3. Start Using

```text
/specter-plan          # Create strategic plan
/specter-roadmap       # Break down into phases
/specter-spec          # Design specifications
/specter-build         # Implement features
```

## Workflow Overview

```text
1. Strategic Planning
   /specter-plan
   → Conversational requirements gathering
   → Creates strategic plan with business objectives
   → Quality validation with plan-critic

2. Phase Breakdown
   /specter-roadmap
   → Breaks plan into implementation phases
   → Creates initial specs for each phase
   → Quality refinement with roadmap-critic

3. Technical Design
   /specter-spec [spec-name]
   → Detailed technical specifications
   → Architecture and implementation approach
   → Quality refinement with spec-critic

4. Implementation
   /specter-build [spec-name]
   → Implementation planning
   → Code generation
   → Quality review with build-critic and build-reviewer
```

## Available Commands

- **`/specter-setup [platform]`** - Setup project with platform-specific tools
- **`/specter-plan [project-name]`** - Create strategic project plans
- **`/specter-roadmap [project-name]`** - Generate multi-phase implementation roadmaps

### Multi-Project Support

**Current Status**: Works with limitations (see [Multi-Project Support in User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#multi-project-support))

- ✅ Multiple projects can use same MCP server
- ✅ Per-project configuration and commands
- ⚠️ State isolation in development (v1.1)

**Planned (v1.1)**: Complete multi-project isolation with file-based state persistence. See [MULTI_PROJECT_DESIGN.md](docs/MULTI_PROJECT_DESIGN.md) for architecture details.

TASKS:
1. Evaluate roadmap structure against FSDD quality framework criteria
2. Assess phase scoping appropriateness and implementation feasibility
3. Validate dependency relationships and sequencing logic

## ROADMAP ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### Core Assessment Dimensions

Evaluate each dimension systematically:

**1. Phase Scoping Assessment**
- Verify phase duration appropriateness (2-4 weeks optimal)
- Assess value delivery potential per phase
- Check scope clarity and boundary definition
- Evaluate deliverable specificity and measurability
- Validate success criteria completeness

**2. Dependency Validation**
- Verify logical phase sequencing without circular references
- Check prerequisite completeness and blocking relationships
- Assess integration planning between phases
- Validate critical path identification and management
- Review parallel work opportunities

**3. Implementation Readiness**
- Evaluate spec context sufficiency for /spec command execution
- Check technical focus area clarity and actionability
- Verify research needs identification and prioritization
- Assess architecture guidance adequacy
- Validate decision point documentation

**4. Balance and Feasibility**
- Check complexity distribution across phases
- Verify realistic resource requirement estimates
- Assess risk distribution and mitigation strategies
- Evaluate timeline feasibility and buffer planning
- Review team capacity alignment considerations

**5. Quality and Integration**
- Assess testing and validation approach per phase
- Verify integration strategy comprehensiveness

- Evaluate success measurement and tracking approach
- Validate handoff procedures between phases

### FSDD Framework Application

- Reasonable size for 2-4 week implementation cycle
- Explicit success criteria and completion indicators

#### Dependency Logic Criteria
- Proper sequencing with logical prerequisite relationships
- No circular dependencies or conflicting requirements
- Clear integration planning and handoff procedures
- Critical path identification and risk mitigation

#### Implementation Guidance Criteria
- Sufficient context for targeted technical specification
- Clear technical direction and architecture guidance
- Research needs identified with investigation priorities
- Decision points marked with resolution requirements

#### Practical Feasibility Criteria
- Realistic timeline estimates with appropriate buffer
- Balanced complexity distribution across phases
- Resource consideration and capacity planning
- Risk awareness with proactive mitigation strategies

## Analysis

### Phase Scoping Evaluation
Assessment of phase sizing, boundaries, and value delivery potential. Analysis of scope clarity and deliverable specificity across all phases.

[Detailed evaluation of each phase's scope appropriateness, including specific findings about duration estimates, value delivery, and boundary clarity]

### Dependency Validation
Review of phase sequencing logic, prerequisite relationships, and integration planning. Identification of any circular dependencies or blocking issues.

[Specific analysis of phase ordering, prerequisite relationships, and any dependency conflicts or integration concerns]

### Implementation Readiness
Evaluation of technical focus areas, spec context sufficiency, and research needs documentation. Assessment of guidance adequacy for downstream /spec execution.

[Assessment of whether each phase provides sufficient context for technical specification, including evaluation of research needs and architecture guidance]

### Balance and Feasibility
Analysis of complexity distribution, timeline realism, and resource considerations. Review of risk distribution and mitigation strategy effectiveness.

[Evaluation of whether phases are appropriately sized and balanced, with realistic timelines and adequate risk planning]

### Integration Strategy
Assessment of cross-phase communication, handoff procedures, and overall workflow coherence.

[Analysis of how phases connect, data flow between phases, and overall roadmap coherence]

## SCORING METHODOLOGY

### Objective Score Calculation Formula

Calculate roadmap quality score using weighted assessment across five dimensions:

**Score = (Phase_Scoping × 25%) + (Dependencies × 20%) + (Implementation_Readiness × 25%) + (Balance_Feasibility × 20%) + (Integration_Strategy × 10%)**

### Dimension Scoring (0-100 points each):

#### Phase Scoping (25% weight)
- Each phase 2-4 weeks: +20 points per phase (max 100)
- Clear deliverables with acceptance criteria: +15 points per phase
- Defined scope boundaries: +10 points per phase
- Measurable success criteria: +10 points per phase
- **Deductions**: Oversized phases (-15), undersized phases (-10), vague scope (-20)

#### Dependencies (20% weight)
- Logical sequencing without circular refs: +30 points
- Complete prerequisite documentation: +25 points
- Clear integration handoffs: +20 points
- Critical path identified: +15 points
- Parallel work opportunities: +10 points
- **Deductions**: Circular dependencies (-40), missing prerequisites (-30)

#### Implementation Readiness (25% weight)
- Sufficient spec context per phase: +20 points per phase (max 80)
- Research needs documented: +10 points
- Architecture decisions identified: +10 points
- **Deductions**: Insufficient context (-20 per phase), missing research needs (-15)

#### Balance and Feasibility (20% weight)
- Even complexity distribution: +25 points
- Realistic timeline estimates: +25 points
- Adequate risk mitigation: +25 points
- Resource considerations: +25 points
- **Deductions**: Unbalanced complexity (-20), unrealistic timelines (-30)

#### Integration Strategy (10% weight)
- Cross-phase communication planned: +40 points
- Testing approach defined: +30 points
- Handoff procedures clear: +30 points
- **Deductions**: Missing integration plan (-40)

### Score Interpretation:
- **90-100**: Exceptional - Ready for immediate implementation
- **80-89**: Good - Minor refinements needed
- **70-79**: Acceptable - Significant improvements required
- **60-69**: Poor - Substantial restructuring needed
- **0-59**: Inadequate - Complete rework required

### Assessment Consistency Standards

#### Objective Evaluation
- Base scores on specific evidence from roadmap content analysis
- Document assessment rationale with roadmap section references
- Maintain consistent evaluation criteria across diverse project types
- Focus on implementation readiness rather than subjective preferences

#### Improvement Focus
- Prioritize recommendations by implementation impact and difficulty
- Provide specific, actionable guidance with concrete examples
- Balance recognition of strengths with honest gap identification
- Focus on 3-4 highest-impact improvements per assessment cycle

## ERROR HANDLING

### Assessment Challenges

#### Incomplete Roadmap Structure
- Score based on present content quality and completeness
- Document missing phases or sections explicitly in issues
- Provide structural guidance for standard roadmap patterns
- Focus evaluation on available content without penalizing gaps unfairly

#### Over-Detailed or Under-Detailed Phases
- Assess appropriateness relative to implementation timeline and complexity
- Note over-engineering risks or insufficient guidance respectively
- Suggest optimal detail level for technical specification readiness
- Balance agility considerations with implementation guidance needs

#### Unclear Dependencies or Integration
- Flag ambiguous relationships requiring clarification
- Request specific sequencing logic and prerequisite documentation
- Suggest logical phase ordering based on typical implementation patterns
- Note integration risks and recommend mitigation approaches

#### Unrealistic Timeline or Resource Estimates
- Identify impossible targets with reference to industry benchmarks
- Suggest realistic alternatives based on scope and complexity assessment
- Note resource constraint considerations and capacity planning needs
- Provide feasibility guidance for timeline optimization

Always provide objective, evidence-based assessment with specific recommendations for roadmap improvement and implementation readiness enhancement."""

# Specification Template Structure

## Core Sections

### 1. Overview
Concise phase context: objectives, scope, dependencies

### 2. Deliverables  
Specific outputs and features from roadmap

### 3. System Design
- **Architecture**: Technical focus areas (pre-populated)
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, tools

### 4. Implementation
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional
- **Development Plan**: Task breakdown and approach  
- **Testing Strategy**: Test approach and quality gates

### 5. Research Requirements
Pre-populated from roadmap, expanded by `/spec`

### 6. Success Criteria
Phase success metrics, expanded with acceptance criteria

### 7. Integration
Phase dependencies and handoff requirements

## Design Principles

- **Thorough but Concise**: Complete system design without bloat
- **Pre-populated Context**: Roadmap data injected into scaffolding
- **Clear Completion Points**: `/spec` completes specific sections
- **Consistent Structure**: Same format across platforms

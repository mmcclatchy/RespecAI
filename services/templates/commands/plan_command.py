# Strategic Planning Orchestration

## State Management
#### Track only essential orchestration state:

- **PROJECT_NAME**: String from user command arguments - used as identifier for human-driven plan generation phase
- **ANALYST_LOOP_ID**: String returned from MCP `mcp__specter__initialize_refinement_loop('analyst')` - required for MCP loop management during analyst validation
- **QUALITY_SCORE**: Integer from plan-critic feedback retrieval - for user decision support
- **ANALYST_SCORE**: Integer from analyst-critic feedback retrieval - needed for MCP loop decisions
- **USER_DECISION**: String from user choice - values: "continue_conversation", "refine_plan", "accept_plan"

#### Data Storage Pattern:
All workflow data is stored in MCP Server using PROJECT_NAME as identifier for human-driven phases:
- Conversation context → `mcp__specter__store_conversation_context(PROJECT_NAME, context)`
- Strategic plans → `mcp__specter__store_project_plan(PROJECT_NAME, plan_markdown)`
- Plan feedback → `mcp__specter__store_critic_feedback(PROJECT_NAME, feedback_markdown)`
- Analysis results → Agent MCP tools handle storage using ANALYST_LOOP_ID during analyst validation phase
- Human-driven phases use PROJECT_NAME; agentic validation uses ANALYST_LOOP_ID

## Step 1: Initialize Conversation Context

#### Set up the conversational planning workflow:

#### Set initial context:
- Extract PROJECT_NAME from first argument in `$ARGUMENTS`
- Use remaining arguments as initial conversation context
- If no conversation context provided, start with: "I need help creating a strategic plan for my project"
- Initialize variables for state management throughout the human-driven process
- Note: No refinement loop needed for human-driven plan generation phase

## Step 2: Conversational Requirements Gathering

#### Use the /plan-conversation command to conduct conversational discovery.

Invoke the plan-conversation agent with initial context:
```
Initial Context: $ARGUMENTS or "I need help creating a strategic plan for my project"
```

#### Store conversation results in MCP:
```
Store conversation context using: mcp__specter__store_conversation_context(PROJECT_NAME, conversation_results)
```

Expected structured format from plan-conversation:
```json
{{'vision': {{'problem_statement': "...",
    "desired_outcome": "...",
    "success_metrics": "..."
  }},
  "business_context": {{'business_drivers': "...",
    "stakeholder_needs": "...",
    "organizational_constraints": "..."
  }},
  "requirements": {{'functional': [...],
    "user_experience": [...],
    "integration": [...],
    "performance": [...],
    "security": [...],
    "technical_constraints": [...]
  }},
  "constraints": {{'timeline': [...],
    "resource": [...],
    "business": [...],
    "technical": [...]
  }},
  "priorities": {{'must_have': [...],
    "nice_to_have": [...]
  }}
}}
```

## Step 3: Create Strategic Plan Document

#### Transform conversation context into a strategic plan document:

Retrieve conversation context from MCP and create strategic plan:
```text
Conversation context available via: mcp__specter__get_conversation_context(PROJECT_NAME)
Previous feedback available via: mcp__specter__get_previous_feedback(PROJECT_NAME)
```

#### Create strategic plan using template:
```markdown
{project_plan_template}
```

#### Store the strategic plan in MCP:
```text
Store strategic plan using: mcp__specter__store_project_plan(PROJECT_NAME, strategic_plan_markdown)
```

Strategic plan creation process:
1. **Retrieve conversation context** from MCP storage (automatic)
2. **Structure into strategic plan format** using the template above
3. **Incorporate previous feedback** if available from MCP
4. **Store complete strategic plan** in MCP for agent access

## Step 4: Quality Assessment

Invoke the plan-critic agent with project name for plan retrieval:

```text
Invoke: plan-critic
Input: PROJECT_NAME
```

#### Plan-critic workflow:
1. **Agent retrieves strategic plan** from MCP using get_project_plan_markdown(PROJECT_NAME)
2. **Agent evaluates plan** against FSDD framework
3. **Agent stores feedback** using store_critic_feedback(PROJECT_NAME, feedback_markdown)

#### Extract quality score for user decision:
```text
Retrieve feedback using: mcp__specter__get_previous_feedback(PROJECT_NAME)
Extract QUALITY_SCORE from feedback overall_score field
```

## Step 5: Present Quality Assessment and User Decision

#### Present the quality assessment to the user:

Retrieve and display plan quality results:

```text
Retrieve quality feedback: mcp__specter__get_previous_feedback(PROJECT_NAME)
Display QUALITY_SCORE and feedback summary to user
```

Present options to user:

```markdown
## Strategic Plan Quality Assessment

#### Plan Overview:
- Quality Score: [QUALITY_SCORE from MCP feedback]%

#### Quality Summary:
[Feedback summary from MCP stored feedback]

#### Your Options:

1. **Continue conversation** - Add more details through additional /plan-conversation
   - Best if: Missing requirements, unclear scope, or need more context
   - Action: Return to conversational discovery for specific areas

2. **Refine plan** - Generate improved version addressing feedback
   - Best if: Content exists but needs better organization or clarity
   - Action: Create new strategic plan version with targeted improvements

3. **Accept plan** - Proceed with current plan to objective extraction
   - Best if: Plan meets your needs and you're ready to move forward
   - Action: Continue to automated objective validation phase

#### Please choose your preferred option (1, 2, or 3):
```

#### Wait for user response and process decision:

#### If user chooses "1" (Continue conversation):
- Set USER_DECISION = "continue_conversation"
- Return to Step 2 (conversation context already stored in MCP)
- plan-conversation agent will access existing context and continue discovery

#### If user chooses "2" (Refine plan):
- Set USER_DECISION = "refine_plan"
- Append refinement context to MCP: store critic feedback as refinement guidance
- Return to Step 3 to generate improved strategic plan using stored feedback

#### If user chooses "3" (Accept plan):
- Set USER_DECISION = "accept_plan"
- Strategic plan already stored in MCP from Step 3 using PROJECT_NAME
- Proceed to Step 6 for automated objective extraction

## Error Recovery and Resilience

### Agent Invocation Failures

**strategic plan creation failures:**
1. **Empty or Invalid Context**: If CONVERSATION_CONTEXT is empty or malformed:
   - Retry /plan-conversation command with same initial context
   - If second attempt fails, continue with placeholder: "Plan creation failed - proceeding with basic template"
   - Update CURRENT_PLAN with failure notification for critic evaluation

2. **Context Overflow**: If CONVERSATION_CONTEXT exceeds processing limits:
   - Trigger context summarization: Extract key points from CONVERSATION_CONTEXT
   - Create strategic plan with summarized context (max 2000 characters)
   - If still fails, proceed with minimal template-based planning

3. **Template Processing Errors**: If strategic plan template cannot be populated:
   - Continue with basic markdown structure
   - Document template failure in CURRENT_PLAN output
   - Notify user of reduced functionality

**plan-critic failures:**
1. **Score Extraction Failure**: If QUALITY_SCORE cannot be parsed:
   - Use fallback score for MCP decision processing
   - Set CRITIC_FEEDBACK = "Critic assessment failed - manual review required"
   - Continue refinement loop with manual oversight

2. **Empty Feedback**: If CRITIC_FEEDBACK is empty or unparsable:
   - Set CRITIC_FEEDBACK = "General improvement needed - refine based on FSDD framework"
   - Continue with generic refinement guidance

**plan-analyst failures:**
1. **Objective Extraction Failure**: If plan-analyst returns invalid structure:
   - Retry once with explicit format requirements
   - If still fails, provide manual objective extraction template
   - Continue with basic objective structure

### MCP Tool Failures

**mcp__specter__initialize_refinement_loop failures (analyst phase only):**
1. **Loop Creation Error**: If ANALYST_LOOP_ID generation fails:
   - Generate local tracking ID (timestamp-based) for analyst phase
   - Continue without MCP loop management for analyst validation
   - Use fallback decision logic without MCP guidance for analyst refinement

2. **Server Unavailable**: If MCP server is unreachable:
   - Fall back to local analyst loop management
   - Display warning: "MCP analyst loop management unavailable - using local fallback"

**mcp__specter__decide_loop_next_action failures:**
1. **Decision Service Error**: If decision cannot be retrieved:
   - Apply basic fallback decision logic based on previous iteration patterns
   - Continue with fallback decision
   - Log decision reasoning for user

### Context Management Edge Cases

#### Context Window Exhaustion:
1. **Warning Threshold (80% capacity)**: 
   - Trigger progressive summarization of CONVERSATION_CONTEXT
   - Preserve most recent 20% and highest-priority 30% of content
   - Continue with condensed context

2. **Critical Threshold (95% capacity)**:
   - Emergency context compression: Keep only current iteration data
   - Store full context in CURRENT_PLAN for persistence
   - Notify user of context limitation

3. **Context Loss Recovery**:
   - If context is lost during processing, attempt recovery from CURRENT_PLAN
   - Use plan-analyst to reconstruct key requirements
   - Continue with reconstructed minimal context

#### Variable State Corruption:
1. **Missing Variables**: If any tracked variable becomes undefined:
   - Reinitialize with safe defaults
   - Attempt recovery from previous agent outputs
   - Continue with recovered or default values

2. **Invalid Variable Types**: If variables contain unexpected data types:
   - Clean and convert to expected format
   - Log data cleaning actions
   - Continue with sanitized variables

## Step 6: Initialize Analyst Validation Loop

#### Initialize the MCP refinement loop for analyst validation:

Use the MCP tool `mcp__specter__initialize_refinement_loop`:
- Call `mcp__specter__initialize_refinement_loop(loop_type='analyst')`
- Store the returned `ANALYST_LOOP_ID` for tracking throughout the analyst validation process
- Copy strategic plan from PROJECT_NAME to ANALYST_LOOP_ID for analyst processing

## Step 7: Extract Objectives

After plan acceptance, invoke the plan-analyst agent with analyst loop ID:

```text
Invoke: plan-analyst
Input: ANALYST_LOOP_ID
```

#### Plan-analyst workflow:
1. **Agent retrieves strategic plan** from MCP using get_project_plan_markdown(ANALYST_LOOP_ID)
2. **Agent checks for previous analysis** using get_previous_analysis(ANALYST_LOOP_ID)
3. **Agent extracts structured objectives** from strategic plan
4. **Agent stores analysis** using store_current_analysis(ANALYST_LOOP_ID, analysis)

## Step 8: Analyst Quality Assessment

Invoke the analyst-critic agent with loop ID:

```text
Invoke: analyst-critic
Input: ANALYST_LOOP_ID
```

#### Analyst-critic workflow:
1. **Agent retrieves business objectives analysis** from MCP using get_previous_analysis(ANALYST_LOOP_ID)
2. **Agent retrieves original strategic plan** from MCP using get_project_plan_markdown(ANALYST_LOOP_ID)
3. **Agent validates extraction quality** against validation framework
4. **Agent stores feedback** using store_current_objective_feedback(ANALYST_LOOP_ID, feedback)

#### Extract analyst score for MCP decision:
```text
Retrieve feedback using: mcp__specter__get_previous_objective_feedback(ANALYST_LOOP_ID)
Extract ANALYST_SCORE from feedback overall_score field
```

## Step 9: Analyst Validation Loop

#### Call the MCP Server for analyst validation decision:

Use the MCP tool `mcp__specter__decide_loop_next_action`:
- Call `mcp__specter__decide_loop_next_action(LOOP_ID=ANALYST_LOOP_ID, current_score=ANALYST_SCORE)`
- The MCP Server will determine the next action based on configured criteria
- Store the returned status as ANALYST_LOOP_STATUS
- Display the analyst score and MCP decision to the user

#### Process the MCP Server decision:

#### If status is "refine":
- Objectives and feedback already stored in MCP by agent
- Previous feedback available to plan-analyst via MCP tools
- Re-invoke plan-analyst with ANALYST_LOOP_ID (return to Step 7)

#### If status is "user_input":
- Present current analyst score and request user clarification
- Wait for user response and incorporate into objectives analysis
- Continue analyst validation loop (return to Step 7)

#### If status is "completed":
- Final objectives and feedback already stored in MCP by agent
- Generate completion report using data from MCP storage
- Store completion report: `mcp__specter__store_plan_completion_report(PROJECT_NAME, completion_report_markdown)`
- Display completion message with final analyst score
- Present final output using the stored completion report
- Create external project using {tools.create_project_external}
- Create external project completion using {tools.create_project_completion_external}

## Final Output Format
```markdown
{plan_completion_template}
```

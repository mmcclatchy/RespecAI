## Overview

### Feature Description
Secure user authentication with multi-factor support

### Problem Statement
Users need secure access to the platform with protection against unauthorized access

### Target Users
All platform users including administrators and end-users

### Business Value
Increased security compliance and user trust leading to higher retention

## Requirements

### User Stories
As a user, I want to log in securely so that my account is protected from unauthorized access

### Acceptance Criteria
User can login with email/password, MFA is required for admin accounts, password reset functionality works

### User Experience Goals
Simple login process, clear error messages, quick authentication under 2 seconds

## Technical Specifications

### Functional Requirements
JWT token-based authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, session management

### Non-Functional Requirements
99.9% uptime, sub-1s login response time, support for 10,000 concurrent users

### Integration Requirements
OAuth providers (Google, GitHub), LDAP integration, audit logging system

## Metrics

### User Metrics
User login success rate >95%, password reset completion rate >90%

### Performance Metrics
Average login time <1s, token refresh time <200ms, system availability >99.9%

### Technical Metrics
Failed authentication attempts <5%, security incidents = 0, API response time <500ms

## Feature Prioritization

### Must Have
Email/password login, secure session management, password reset via email

### Should Have
Two-factor authentication, OAuth integration, remember me functionality

### Could Have
Biometric authentication, single sign-on, social media integration

### Won't Have
SMS-based authentication (privacy concerns), password sharing features

## Metadata

### Status
approved

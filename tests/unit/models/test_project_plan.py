## Executive Summary

**Vision**: `Transform customer experience through modern, intuitive portal design`
**Mission**: `Deliver a user-friendly portal that increases customer satisfaction and reduces support tickets`
**Timeline**: `8 months from project kickoff to production deployment`
**Budget**: `$400,000 including development, design, and infrastructure costs`

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objectives
`Improve customer satisfaction scores by 30%, reduce support tickets by 25%, increase portal usage by 50%`

### Success Metrics
`Customer satisfaction score >4.5/5, support ticket reduction >25%, user engagement increase >50%`

### Key Performance Indicators
`Daily active users, session duration, task completion rates, customer feedback scores`

## Project Scope

### Included Features
`User dashboard redesign, mobile responsive design, self-service features, account management tools`

### Excluded Features
`Legacy system migration, third-party integrations, advanced analytics dashboard`

### Assumptions
`Existing infrastructure can support new portal, customers will adopt new design, no major security changes needed`

### Constraints
`Must maintain 99.9% uptime during migration, limited to current technology stack, budget cap at $400k`

## Stakeholders

### Project Sponsor
`Chief Technology Officer - Sarah Johnson, provides strategic direction and final approvals`

### Key Stakeholders
`Customer Success team, IT Operations, Security team, Executive leadership, Customer Advisory Board`

### End Users
`Existing customers (5000+ active users), customer support representatives, account managers`

## Project Structure

### Work Breakdown
`Phase 1: Research & Design (2 months), Phase 2: Development (4 months), Phase 3: Testing & Launch (2 months)`

### Phases Overview
`Discovery and user research, UI/UX design, frontend development, backend API updates, testing, deployment`

### Dependencies
`Design system completion, API documentation updates, security review approval, infrastructure scaling`

## Resource Requirements

### Team Structure
`1 Project Manager, 2 Frontend Developers, 1 Backend Developer, 1 UI/UX Designer, 1 QA Engineer`

### Technology Stack
`React.js frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, AWS cloud infrastructure, Docker containers`

### Infrastructure Needs
`Additional AWS instances, CDN setup, staging environment, monitoring tools, backup systems`

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
`Timeline delays due to design complexity, integration challenges with legacy systems, user adoption resistance`

### Mitigation Strategies
`Regular design reviews, early integration testing, comprehensive user training program, phased rollout`

### Contingency Plans
`Simplified design fallback, manual processes for critical features, extended support period post-launch`

## Quality Assurance

### Quality Standards
`WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, mobile-first responsive design, 99.9% uptime requirement`

### Testing Strategy
`Unit testing (90% coverage), integration testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing, security testing`

### Acceptance Criteria
`All user stories complete, performance benchmarks met, security scan passed, stakeholder sign-off received`

## Communication Plan

### Reporting Structure
`Weekly status reports to sponsor, bi-weekly stakeholder updates, monthly executive briefings`

### Meeting Schedule
`Daily standups, weekly team meetings, bi-weekly stakeholder reviews, monthly steering committee`

### Documentation Standards
`Confluence for project docs, Jira for task tracking, GitHub for code documentation, shared drive for assets`

# MCP Memory Future Features

## Overview

This document captures advanced features and capabilities that were deferred from the initial MCP Memory Architecture implementation. These features represent valuable enhancements but are not required for the core functionality and can be implemented in future iterations based on actual usage patterns and needs.

## Recently Identified Future Features

### 1. Context Overflow Prevention and Management

**Description**: Proactive context size monitoring with automatic summarization to prevent workflow failures due to context window exhaustion.

**Current Problem**:
- `/specter-plan` workflow manages 15+ variables with complex conversation contexts
- No proactive context management leads to workflow crashes when context limits exceeded
- Multiple refinement cycles cause context bloat without mitigation
- Context overflow can occur during conversation gathering, plan generation, or critic feedback accumulation

**Proposed Solution**:
- Context size monitoring with configurable warning and critical thresholds
- Automatic context summarization preserving key information
- Progressive context compression maintaining recent and high-priority content
- Context recovery mechanisms when context is lost during processing

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
class ContextManager:
    def check_context_size(self, context: str) -> tuple[str, bool]:
        if len(context) > CONTEXT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD:
            return self.emergency_compress(context), True
        elif len(context) > CONTEXT_WARNING_THRESHOLD:
            return self.progressive_summarize(context), False
        return context, False

    def progressive_summarize(self, context: str) -> str:
        # Preserve most recent 20% and highest-priority 30% of content
        # Summarize middle sections while maintaining structure

    def emergency_compress(self, context: str) -> str:
        # Keep only current iteration data and critical variables
        # Store full context in persistent storage for recovery
```

**Why Future Feature**:
- Current system needs to prove baseline functionality first
- Context overflow patterns need to be observed to optimize compression strategies
- Advanced summarization algorithms require understanding of actual content patterns
- Emergency scenarios are rare but need systematic approach

**Implementation Priority**: High (25% consistency improvement potential)

### 2. Centralized Error Recovery Orchestration

**Description**: Comprehensive error handling framework with automatic recovery strategies and centralized failure management across the entire `/specter-plan` workflow.

**Current Problem**:
- Error handling scattered across workflow steps with inconsistent patterns
- Agent failures (plan-conversation, plan-critic, plan-analyst, analyst-critic) handled locally
- No systematic fallback strategies for common failure modes
- MCP tool failures lack comprehensive recovery mechanisms
- Variable state corruption not automatically detected or recovered

**Proposed Solution**:
- Centralized `WorkflowErrorRecovery` class managing all error scenarios
- Automatic recovery strategies with multiple fallback approaches
- Error categorization (transient, configuration, data, external service)
- Graceful degradation maintaining partial workflow functionality
- State validation and automatic correction for variable corruption

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
class WorkflowErrorRecovery:
    def handle_agent_failure(self, step: str, agent: str, error: Exception) -> RecoveryAction:
        error_category = self.categorize_error(error)

        if error_category == ErrorType.TRANSIENT:
            return self.retry_with_backoff(step, agent)
        elif error_category == ErrorType.CONTEXT_OVERFLOW:
            return self.trigger_context_compression(step)
        elif error_category == ErrorType.MCP_UNAVAILABLE:
            return self.fallback_to_local_mode(step)
        else:
            return self.graceful_degradation(step, error)

    def validate_workflow_state(self, state: dict) -> StateValidationResult:
        # Check all required variables are present and valid
        # Detect state corruption patterns
        # Suggest recovery actions

    def graceful_degradation(self, step: str, error: Exception) -> RecoveryAction:
        # Continue workflow with reduced functionality
        # Document degradation for user awareness
        # Provide manual override options
```

**Error Recovery Strategies**:
- **Agent Failures**: Retry with simplified context, fallback to template-based generation
- **MCP Tool Failures**: Local state management fallbacks, manual workflow progression
- **Context Overflow**: Emergency compression, workflow checkpoint/resume
- **Variable Corruption**: State validation, automatic variable reconstruction
- **Template Failures**: Fallback to basic markdown generation, manual template completion

**Why Future Feature**:
- Current basic error handling sufficient for initial stability testing
- Error patterns need to be observed before optimizing recovery strategies
- Advanced recovery mechanisms add significant complexity to workflow
- System needs to demonstrate core functionality before adding resilience layers

**Implementation Priority**: High (40% reliability improvement potential)

### 3. Platform Syncing

**Description**: Allow users to modify platform plans/specter-specs/documents/comments in the external platform. Sync any changes in these documents to the MCP memory.

**Why Future Feature**:
- Currently there is little to no good way for users to manually modify the MCP memory
- This provides an intuitive way to modify and maintain the state of those documents in the MCP Server

**Implementation Approach**:
- Keep a location field for each document, which can be a URL or a file path
- Create a new MCP Tool for each document that searches the location for any changes and updates the current state in the MCP Memory
- Leverage the external MCP Tools instead of building the code internal to the MCP Server
  - Using python SDKs may not be available for all platforms and create additional complexity
  - While an SDK integration would be more reliable, it is not a requirement for MVP

**Why Deferred**:
- Static templates sufficient for initial implementation

- Template parsing to models requires sophisticated markdown analysis
- Current manual sync manageable with small number of models

**Future Implementation Notes**:

## Decision Framework for Future Features

### Questions to Ask Before Implementation
1. **Usage Evidence**: Is there clear evidence this feature is needed based on actual usage?
2. **Complexity vs Benefit**: Does the benefit clearly outweigh the implementation complexity?
3. **Core vs Enhancement**: Is this essential for core functionality or an enhancement?
4. **Data Availability**: Do we have sufficient data to implement this feature effectively?
5. **Alternative Solutions**: Could simpler approaches solve the same problem?

### Implementation Triggers
- **User Request**: Multiple users requesting the same capability
- **Performance Issues**: Clear performance bottlenecks that advanced features would solve
- **Workflow Gaps**: Identified gaps in current workflow support

- **Stability Achievement**: Core system stable and ready for enhancement

## Conclusion

These deferred features represent the difference between a sophisticated system and a pragmatic one. By focusing on core functionality first and adding complexity based on actual needs, we can build a system that serves real requirements rather than anticipated ones.

The key principle is to implement features when there's clear evidence they're needed, not when they seem like good ideas in theory.

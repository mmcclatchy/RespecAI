# Spec-Driven Workflow Architecture Analysis

Complete architectural understanding of the Spec-Driven Workflow MCP Server system based on comprehensive analysis and clarifications.

## Project Overview

### Primary Goal
The Spec-Driven Workflow system is a **sophisticated AI workflow orchestration platform** that transforms natural language business requirements into production-ready code through structured, quality-driven development phases. The system bridges human strategic thinking with AI-driven technical execution using a multi-layered architecture with specialized agents and quality gates.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Multi-stage refinement loops** with specialized critic agents at each phase
- **Platform-agnostic storage** (Linear/GitHub/Markdown) with conversion capabilities  
- **Quality-driven progression** through FSDD gates with automated and human-in-the-loop fallbacks
- **Research integration** via global research-synthesizer agent using Exa MCP Server

## Complete Research Flow Architecture

### Research Orchestration Pipeline

```text
spec-architect identifies research needs
    ↓
Archive Scanning: research-advisor-archive-scan.sh checks ~/.claude/best-practices
    ↓
Gap Analysis: spec-architect identifies missing external research
    ↓
Research Prompt Creation: "Best practices when integrating [technologies] [current_year]"
    ↓
/build command orchestrates parallel research-synthesizer calls
    ↓
research-synthesizer instances create documentation files → return file paths
    ↓
build-planner reads ALL provided documentation → creates implementation plan
```

### Research Integration Strategy

**Archive-First Approach**:
- `spec-architect` uses `scripts/research-advisor-archive-scan.sh` to check existing documentation
- Script scans `~/.claude/best-practices` for relevant content using topic queries
- Only missing knowledge triggers external research requests

**External Research Orchestration**:
- Main Agent coordinates parallel `research-synthesizer` instances
- Research prompts follow structured pattern: "Best practices when integrating [technologies] [current_year]"
- Each research instance creates documentation file and returns path (not content)
- `build-planner` receives file paths and reads documentation to create coherent plans

**Research Responsibilities**:
- `spec-architect`: Identify research needs and gaps
- Main Agent: Orchestrate research calls, pass file paths
- `research-synthesizer`: Execute web research via Exa MCP Server
- `build-planner`: Consume all research documentation and synthesize implementation plans

## Quality Scoring & Loop Management Framework

### Scoring Architecture
- **Scale**: 0-100 numerical scores from critic agents
- **Thresholds**: Environment variables managed via Pydantic-Settings (tunable during testing)
- **Assessment**: LLM-based evaluation with structured criteria for consistency
- **MVP Approach**: Accepts reasonable consistency over perfect objectivity

### MCP Server Decision Engine

```text
Critic Score → MCP Server State Management → Next Action Decision:
├── High Score → "complete" (proceed to next phase)
├── Improving Score → "refine" (continue loop with feedback)  
└── Stagnation → "user-input" (escalate to human intervention)
```

### Stagnation Detection Logic
- **Score Plateauing**: No improvement over successive iterations
- **Max Iterations**: Hard limit reached regardless of progress
- **User Escalation**: System requests clarification when automated refinement fails
- **MVP Scope**: No cross-session persistence - stateless loop management

## Seven Refinement Loops Architecture

**Output**: Detailed implementation plan with specific patterns and best-practices

### Loop 7: Code Implementation (`/build` - Phase 2)

## Conclusion

The Spec-Driven Workflow architecture represents a sophisticated yet maintainable approach to AI-assisted software development. Its strength lies in the clear separation of concerns, progressive quality enforcement, and intelligent research integration. The system balances automation with human oversight, providing fallback mechanisms when automated refinement reaches its limits.

The five-loop architecture ensures quality at every stage while maintaining efficiency through parallel processing and archive-first research strategies. The implementation roadmap bridge phase provides crucial structure between strategic planning and technical specification, enabling phase-based development with pre-scaffolded specifications. The platform-agnostic design enables teams to work within their preferred tools while maintaining consistent workflow quality.

This analysis serves as the foundation for understanding system behavior, planning implementations, and making architectural decisions during development and testing phases.
